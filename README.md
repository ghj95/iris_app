# Iris Classifier App

### Overview  
This project is a streamlit-based web application that classifies iris flowers using a random forest model on theb iris dataset. Users can input flower measurements and receive a real-time prediction of the species along with the probability score for each class.

### Features  
* Machine Learning-powered classification** using Scikit-Learnâ€™s Random Forest algorithm.  
* User-friendly input sliders** for sepal and petal dimensions.
* Real-time probability scoring** to indicate prediction confidence.  
* Expandable result sections** for model predictions and probability distributions.  
* Data visualization** for insights into classification outcomes.
* Lightweight and interactive UI** built with Streamlit, Pandas, and NumPy.  

### How It Works  
* Enter **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width** using the sliders in the Streamlit sidebar.  
* The model processes the inputs and **predicts the iris species** (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).  
* The app displays the **predicted species along with the probability score** for accuracy reference.  
* Users can expand sections to **view the available species and model output details**.
